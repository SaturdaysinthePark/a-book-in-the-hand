A simple story about a woman who pours her heart and devotion into everything. Whats quite fascinating is that even in the un-caring, unaffectionate world, Félicité never wavers in her ability to be caring. <br/><br/>Sometimes I felt irritated by Félicité, and wonder if you are supposed to, is she just an utter fool, or is she pure good? Or, is it I, who is a fool for being irritated at Félicité?",,,1,0

If you can look past that, the story is really centered around both universal problems between parents and children and even immigrant parents and their children; but specifically, it dives into the muslim conservative parents, their culture, and their children. I think it's important because it shows how universally a lot is similar between Muslim families and other families - I would hope this paints a path for some empathy.<br/><br/>Among the three children (Hadia, Huda and Amar) it was Amar who stood out, who was the least understood, and the one who struggled to find his place. I saw a lot of friends in Amar's shoes growing up, and Fatima must have also, because she captures things very well here. Its no surprise, because as mentioned above, its a story we've all seen, but with the cultural and religious twist intertwined here, we get this perspective on how Amar's parents' love doesn't translate well to him.<br/><br/>All the little scruples in this book the parents have with their kids are things I have witnessed or seen first hand in Muslim communities, and Fatima surfaces them so accurately in this book: about 'mixed gender' weddings, a Shia Muslim marrying a Sunni Muslim, being scared your 23 year old daughter is too old to get married, taking hijab/veil off, post 9/11 impact, pushing and ingraining responsibility of caring for elders at a super young age, strictness with daughters and leniency with sons, etc... <br/><br/>Read this if your the parents of a Muslim child, or any child for that matter, or plan on having kids. Also its worth reading if you're not Muslim and want to understand some of the nuances your Muslim colleagues may have gone through growing up. Regardless of those reasons, its a great novel, with the third part being a narrative that comes as a surprise and full of deep emotion.",,,1,0

There's a reason why its become a well read book this day and age. This isn't a novel you read for a story/plot, its weak when you approach it as that type of material. Here were my thoughts:<br/><br/>• When it comes down to it, <i>1984</i> is about a world where the few in power control everything to the point of revising history, enforcing conformity, etc.. <br/>• This isn't a book you are reading because of the characters or plot - as much as you're reading a situation and there happens to be a few people involved. You're reading this to understand a possible state of a future reality that is dystopian.<br/>• You're going to read this and draw parallels to everything around you in society, use of technology, government, world politics, war, etc.. <br/>• One can view this as a guidebook to what to look out for and be wary of those who hold power, for instance when government leans more on massive surveillance, rewrites history, propaganda, wealth inequality, has pointless wars, and more.. <br/>• I used to work with tech like Facial Recognition/Computer Vision, which can easily be integrated with surveillance for ill purposes. I couldn't help think while reading this that the technology can be abused (and most likely is) so easily without a lot of detection. Government and others can argue for its need and convince people through a combination of shock doctrine, guilt and other forms of manipulation, that we need more surveillance and its to keep us safe.<br/><br/>All in all, this is quite an intellectual book and will make you think a ton. I've become more aware of my surroundings after reading this, but I wonder if I and most people are drones, like Winston, that take no action and eventually get beaten down and conform. I hope not.",,,1,0

By the end of it, I felt like this book was a bit of a mess.<br/><br/>• Overall, I liked the premise of this book: 'what if the KKK were actual wizards and had actual demons that worked with them' - this sort of magic and fantasy spin on it all was interesting<br/>• I really liked Sadie, she was such a cool character and I liked her persona and mannerism<br/>• At some point the book got very complicated and it was hard to keep track of all the threads and reveals<br/>• The author does a great job with visuals and horror - I wasn't super excited to be reading the demon/monster's descriptions (I mean that as a compliment)<br/>• Parallels and writing devices early in the novel were great, especially when alluding to <i>The Birth of a Nation</i><br/>• It was hard to keep track of all the action and events happening, especially with the introduction of more and more fantasy elements<br/>• By the end, I felt burnt out - I enjoyed parts of the book, but felt overwhelmed by the end, even though it was a short read<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",,,1,0

Van Gogh is one of those artists I grew up learning about, and even have attempted recreating his paintings in art classes. He always fascinated me, especially the story I was told of his tragic life. I think after reading this biography I was able to much more truly understand the tragedy of Van Gogh - its very much debatable whether you can call his life a tragedy in my opinion.<br/><br/>The story of Vincent Van Gogh is very much also the story of Theodore Van Gogh, his brother. Throughout his life, Theo would be the thread that kept Vincent together mentally and financially, which is very apparent from the letters and correspondences available. Theodore was an art dealer who helped position artists such as Monet into stardom. Vincent on the other hand was always a mess, could never hold a job, was difficult with people, and did not have a welcoming personality.<br/><br/>Vincent Van Gogh was a voracious reader, and throughout the biography there are references to the books he reads, from authors like George Eliot to Emile Zola.. we learn a lot about what influences Van Gogh's thoughts. <br/><br/>To summarize his character a bit more, Van Gogh was restless, he had his own unique idea of what an artist should be that everyone else rejected in practice and theory. He quickly fell from grace with those around him, and many did not wish to stay associated with him, to the point that Vincent continuously was becoming more and more isolated. It's clear that Van Gogh didn't kill himself, we won't know for sure, but he was ill to the point that he would cut off his own ear and give it as a present to a woman at a brothel (they don't tell you the brothel part at school, or his obsessive traits in those respects). He was delusional and spiteful, but would change his mood upon realizing his fault, but usually when it was too late. He did not get along with his parents, his own mother pretty much thought it was a good thing he passed away. The art community thought he was a joke, for the most part, and thought the way he painted was scary, rash and odd. Even with a brother like Theo backing him, he wasn't able to gain positive repertoire until the year of his death.<br/><br/>Naifeh and Smith, who co-wrote this biography as well as Jackson Pollock's (which they won the Pulitzer for) are stunningly detailed. I wish they wrote more artist's biographies, because it's so amazing and engrossing the level of detail provided and their ability to capture the life of the artist. <br/><br/>I highly recommend reading this, you'll be able to have a newfound appreciation for him as an artist when you next visit the MoMA, d'Orsay, or his museum in Amsterdam - or if his works end up on loan. You'll see me at the MoMA staring at the Starry Night once again soon!<br/><br/>Words I learned reading this biography:<br/><b>Oeuvre</b>: The collective works of a painter, composer, or author.<br/><b>Truancy</b>: The act of staying away from school.<br/><b>Pedagogue</b>: A teacher, especially strict.<br/><b>Recalcitrant</b>: Having an obstinately uncooperative attitude towards authority and discipline.<br/><b>Casus belli</b>: An act or situation provoking or justifying war.<br/><b>Parveny</b>: A person of obscure origin who has gained wealth, influence, or celebrity.",,,1,0

I'm excited to have finally read this, and can definitely see myself reading this again, or at least sifting through for passages. I definitely thought the structure of the book, while nothing novel, was done in a way to enhance the story, which sometimes is not the case! It was never difficult to follow, and I became quickly invested in both the modern day stories of Ella and Aziz, as well as the story of Shams and Rumi.<br/><br/>There's so much that is quotable in this book, not just the forty rules of love that Shams will drop every now and then where relevant. It's often down to being about the struggle and balance between several different human aspects. Another way to look at it is its about finding your own way through spirituality while maintaining intellectualism. Often, characters in the book will have one and not the other.<br/><br/>I'm a big believer in challenging what I read, and what I'm told - this book does that through Shams' and Aziz's narratives. They constantly challenge the way you think, deliberately placing some vagueness and rationality into a few sentences to communicate a strong point.<br/><br/><blockquote>""Fret not where the road will take you. Instead concentrate on the first step. That is the hardest part and that is what you are responsible for. Once you take that step let everything do what it naturally does and the rest will follow. Don’t go with the flow. Be the flow."" </blockquote><br/><br/>I may not care too much about the whole 'flow' concept, but I completely agree with the above, quite often I concentrate on an entire task beginning to end, when oftentimes if I just take the first step, maybe I'll start seeing the next steps more clearly.<br/><br/><blockquote>“...those who like to swim close to the surface are content with<br/>the outer meaning of the Quran. Many people are like that. They take the verses too literally...""</blockquote><br/><br/>As a Muslim, I have thought a lot about the above. Our accepted interpretation is forced down upon us, its rationalized, but the reality is that the interpretations that have been taught to us are all human interpretations, and humans and society change. Nobody can perfectly interpret it, and nobody has, so what is it we are really believing and following? I tend to challenge all scholars and imams these days, and this book basically stroked that mental wave into a tsunami. I really loved the bits where Shams challenges Rumi, especially when he challenges him to walk into a tavern, it really reflects our current state of the world. Among Muslims, going to a bar/tavern was, and still is, quite a taboo act that many judge other Muslims by without knowing the full context of their visit. Elif encapsulates so much in that one example with how people judge others but based on lack of true knowledge as to that person's intentions.<br/><br/>This book really makes you think and reflect on aspects of your own life. That is essentially what makes this book (or any book) great.<br/><br/>Words I learned from this book:<br/><b>Supercilious</b>: Behaving as if one is superior to others<br/><b>Mendicant</b>:  Given to begging<br/><b>Vacillate</b>: Alternate or waver between different options or actions; be indecisive<br/><b>Peccadillo</b>: A small relatively unimportant sin<br/>",,,1,0

I'm glad she's put this book together, and I'm glad there is hype around it, because what she discusses (for the most part) is important! This book is about our current culture paradigm around topics of beauty, feminism, religion, etc... each told in its own essay written by Jia.<br/><br/>Their is an entire chapter dedicated to Beauty, Lululemon, the rise of the work out class culture, the perfect body etc.. was eye-opening. It's good that we diversify more now on what is beauty but its bad that society still values 'beauty'.

We've lost the Elizabeth Bennets (from Pride and Prejudice) in literature these days. Then there's Emma Bovary and Anna Karenina, both commit suicide. Jia juxtaposes the two literary icons because of their 'unhappy' marriages which is a reflection of not being able to achieve what they want because of the society they live in. It was a bit more academic of an essay, but it definitely got me (a reader) interested.<br/><br/>This book probably could have done without the second essay about a reality tv show Jia was in.. it was the only weak part of this, in my opinion. <br/><br/>There's a good reason why this has a lot of attention right now, even from Barack Obama.

I also really enjoyed how she narrates, mainly because she's 'talking' to the reader, and recalling her in-person experience at hospitals and other places. She does her homework properly!<br/><br/>I never realized how difficult medical research has been due to the lack of suitable cadavers or skeletons/bones. Not to mention, how we need to give students in medical school access to cadavers and skeletons so that they have a close representative of what they will be dealing with when working with patients. So difficult, in fact, that there are sections of this book about body-snatching, grave robbing and black markets for the production and sale of cadavers.<br/><br/>She goes over a lot more, some really interesting threads on cannibalism, burials/funerals, and then there's testing/experimenting with cadavers - apparently Wayne State University in Detroit and the car companies surrounding are some of the biggest researchers that use cadavers for car safety research!<br/><br/>Overall, this was a great book, maybe not for the squeamish.

One from a business point of view, what am I doing to my customers when I present them choices or lack of choices? Second from a personal point of view, how am I mentally draining myself when it comes to choices.<br/><br/>I fall into the category of maximizers, that is someone who seeks only the best choices. That means I tend to take a longer time making a decision, looking for the best deal, making sure my choice of a product or experience exceeds all others, etc... I never classified myself that way, and furthermore, its only with certain types of products/experiences that I try to maximize. If I think and self-reflect really hard, I probably maximize the choice of who my friends are, or how I spend my time. I tend to think of the opportunity cost of everything and its trickle down effects.<br/><br/>Schwartz breaks down many of the aspects of what leads up to making a choice, making a choice, and the aftermath of making a choice. What he ultimately advises is that we become 'Satisficers', that is someone who makes a decision once their criteria is met. So instead of searching for the best deal, having anticipated regret, etc... a satisficer has pre-set criteria and makes their decision based on that.<br/><br/>I would recommend anyone to read this, especially since we're all facing the problem of having to make a decision given a number of choices.

I loved the character of Jenny, she takes the feminist role to an extreme, which I believe Irving assigns to her, to draw out a larger point about how far can movements in Feminism go before they turn to ridiculousness - not that there is anything wrong with the movement. I think about the same thing with other movements.<br/><br/>Jenny goes on to become a well-known writer and feminist hero. Garp, on the other hand, struggles with his writing, with romance/marriage (a thing Jenny didn't anticipate), eventually gets published but overall is a pretty funny and dismal example of a son in the context of his strong feminist mother Jenny. <br/><br/>In general, this novel is complex, full of irony, and fun to read.

At some points I was thinking, ""Wow, so even a person of this level of power,  status and influence could hold these types of thoughts..""  I've read this multiple times, and each time there's more to gleam from it than before.<br/><br/>The more you read other books (especially philosophy and psychology), and the more experienced you are in life, then the more you'll take out of this. I think I came out with a few big thoughts;<br/><br/>• Life is short,creating happiness within it is to create that state of mind and practice. You can waste your life on others' misgivings, or you can choose your own life and carve your own path. How can I get to the point where I live every day as if its my last, but in the sense of I don't have to change my actions on the impending knowledge of Death approaching? He states to himself <i>“Do not waste what remains of your life in speculating about your neighbors. Anything that distracts you from fidelity to the Ruler within you— means a loss of opportunity for some other task.”</i> and <i>""...life is opinion""</i><br/>• Control myself, I don't have to do everything everywhere all the time, nor do I need to react to everything and everyone around me. I don't need to embellish my life for the sake of embellishment. I don't need to respond to everything that I experience and see. Get to the heart of things, don't sprinkle it with anything 'superfluous'. The lower amount of these distractions will indeed lead to more time to focus on myself and what is most important to me and my surroundings.<br/><br/>Overall, this book is a library of prolific and aphoristic thoughts that are quotable and will make you think and reflect on your own life, thoughts, relationships, and well-being:<br/><br/><i>“If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.” </i><br/><i>“Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself in your way of thinking.” </i><br/><i>“The best revenge is not to be like your enemy.” </i><br/><i>“You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.”</i><br/><i>“Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one.”</i><br/><i>“We all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.”</i><br/><br/>Goes without saying, highly recommended.",,,2,0

Some examples include :development of electricity, World War I, or the planes hitting the twin towers on 9/11.<br/><br/>Finding Black Swans can be seen as a problem statement: <i>""...how can we figure out properties of the (infinite) unknown based on the (finite) known?""</i><br/><br/>We tend to to live in our world blind to Black Swan events, and tend to be very bad at predicting them.

I love this book, I love the characters, I love how I felt like I was right in the midst of everything. One way to put this book is that it is about four sisters, their characters, dreams, path to marriage, and the ""castles in the air"" that they wish to build.<br/><br/>This book is filled with so many memorable moments, characters, and scenes. Alcott does a fantastic job at building each character, telling their story, and ultimately make you feel like you are a fly on the wall observing the March family.<br/><br/><i>Little Women</i> is about the March family, during the US Civil War. The father is at war, and mom (Marmee) and the 4 daughters (Meg, Jo, Amy, Beth) are at home living day by day. Meg is the beautiful one, who attends balls and can act. Jo is tomboyish, plans to carve her own destiny and wants to be a famous writer. Amy is the spoiled and snobby one, she wants to marry rich and be a famous artist. Beth is the angel, and is musically talented. With the inclusion of their rich dear neighbor Laurie, they grow and learn from each other into their womanhood. <br/><br/>The love stories in this book are unlike others. Laurie and Jo, Jo and Laurie... theirs (or lack thereof) stinged me the most, the book builds them up as friends but with the undertone that they will love each other. I really felt it when feelings aren't returned. Then there is the constant battle between the Aunt and the girls as it relates to their marital prospects. She insists on advising them to marry wealthy, but the girls know better, they know to marry for reasons other than money. It's pretty central to each character to find their reasons to love. Laurie's grandfathers love is something that was of quite importance to Beth's character, which I thought was a sweet different take. He had a love for a lost daughter that he found again in Beth, and that was quite a beautiful thing to read.<br/><br/>Another big part of the book is pursuing your dreams and passions,  and balancing that with your family, responsibility and duty. Jo is very much the embodiment of that, she relentlessly holds up her desire to be a famous writer, works deliberately and very hard. I think everyone loves Jo because for the most part because she is very much an independent mind, and does not fall for the 'trappings' of love and domestication. She does become a writer, and she does sell her writings and is able to make money for her and her family; however, she eventually finds herself valuing familial and domestic duties. The rest of the sisters have ambition too, but in the end a lot of their ambition changes or gets disrupted by familial responsibilities. <br/><br/>This book is still relevant today, which is a sign of an amazing piece of literature. Everything from the themes of hard work, morality, marriage, love, duty, family, etc.. still resonate. Then there is the added topics around pursuing dreams, independence, feminism, gender roles etc... which are changing and becoming more and more important for us to think about today.<br/><br/><i>Little Women</i> will stay with me for a very long time, I could not recommend it enough. I should probably thank Lindsey and Amanda for putting this in my head ~15 years ago in a video rental store. They mentioned it being their favorite movie, I never watched it, but decided to finally read it. Thank you!<br/><br/><br/>Words I learned:<br/><b>Blithe</b>: Showing a casual and carefree indifference considered to be callous or improper<br/><b>Capacious</b>: Having a lot of space inside<br/><br/>Some phrases I loved:<br/><i>""smell thunder""</i> - I never quite understood that, but also completely understand it<br/><i>""castle in the air""</i> - alluding to our dreams which we wish to pursue",,,1,0

Henry IV part 1 and 2 were about Prince Hal's ascension and removal of his rebellious persona, Henry v is much more about Prince Hal's ability to lead as a king, finding royal purpose and being a general.<br/><br/>Everything from how the Dauphin (French prince) insults Henry V with a gift of tennis balls, implying that he should go play besides himself, to the Battle of Agincourt and Henry's speech to rally the outnumbered troops - make this play witty and gruesome. Its funny to think that just a play ago, Henry V was Prince Hal, a rebellious little rascal prince, and now he is equating himself to Saint George in battle:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>KING HENRY<br/>Follow your spirit, and upon this charge<br/>Cry 'God for Harry, England, and Saint George!'<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Then there is the scene before the Battle of Agincourt, where Henry V disguises himself as a commoner to understand his troops morale and feelings. The troops don't agree with the King, they think the war is pointless, etc.... So, usually when a King does that, he finds out he is doing something wrong or foolish, or being arrogant. But no! King Henry V? He's literally doing God's work, he doesn't feel responsible for their lives, he needs to rally his troops, so he doubles down and delivers one of the most famous speeches ever:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>KING HENRY<br/>We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;<br/>For he to-day that sheds his blood with me<br/>Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,<br/>This day shall gentle his condition;<br/>And gentlemen in England now a-bed<br/>Shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here,<br/>And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks<br/>That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Sadly Falstaff is not a part of this play, he gets silently killed off. <br/><br/>Shakespeare acknowledges at the end that this is a brief glimpse into Henry V's reign, really just about his warfare, and we come to the end here. <br/><br/>Four plays, about kings - who are really just humans with a fancy crown on their heads - trying to do some conquering, and none of them doing anything worthwhile for their people. It's about holding on to power in the face of rebellion, assassination, and more. It's about how it's not about the people or the commoners, who are just ammo to the Kings.",,,1,0

The first being focused on Hal, aka Prince Henry, and his insubordination towards his father, King Henry IV, and his eventual coming to terms with his responsibility and duties as a Prince. Then there is the Welsh rebellion that King Henry IV is dealing with.<br/><br/>Most of the focus is on Hal and his tavern friends as they play pranks, commit robbery, perform plays etc... and are largely influenced by one of Shakespeare's most famous creations, the comedic fat rebellious dishonorable oaf who is named Falstaff.<br/><br/>It's quite a bit more fun to read this play than Richard II, there's more action, more plotting, and Falstaff and Hal's surrogate father-son relationship, along with the tavern crowd, is amusing to see unfold. Falstaff is quick to think on his feet, and 'save' himself from embarrassing situations with just the right words, below he pretends that his cowardice was all an act:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>FALSTAFF<br/>By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye.<br/>Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the<br/>heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince?<br/>why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but<br/>beware instinct; the lion will not touch the true<br/>prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a<br/><b>coward on instinct</b>. I shall think the better of<br/>myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant<br/>lion, and thou for a true prince.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>There's also the question of honor. King Henry IV is making the comparison of Hotspur, who resembles an honorable soldier, to his son Hal, the rebel. Its a central theme in the play, exploring the role of honor in kings, princes, soldiers, commoners, and war. Below Falstaff reflect on the meaning of honor, clearly it means nothing to him, as it is 'air':<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>FALSTAFF<br/>Well, 'tis no matter; honour pricks<br/>me on.

What is<br/>honour? a word. <b>What is in that word honour? what<br/>is that honour? air.</b><br/></blockquote><br/><br/>All in all, this was terrific to read, Shakespeare is far from boring when it comes to telling the History of England in his plays.",,,1,0

His writing is so witty, starting from the writing structure, all the way to the metaphors and reference in dialogue... You'll even want to stand up and drop a soliloquy when you're in the heat of a moment.<br/><br/>In this play, Shakespeare uses Richard II to explore what it means to be a human and to have the identity of a King. Richard II is an incapable King and the play is very much concerning his demise. I'm always quite amused by Shakespeare's wit in writing, the most obscure literary agents are hidden in plain sight. Shakespeare characterizes his actors by the words and style of their dialogue. A central tactic is the contrast of Richard II's dialogue and Henry Boilingbroke's - Richard II seems silly and superfluous whereas Henry's seems much more pointed and tactical.<br/><br/>Richard II is seen as an ineffective monarch through his lengthy dialogues, cited failures with curbing the unrest in England, indecision or ability to take decisive action, and general lack of the people's favor. In Act III, the gardner makes a metaphorical reference to the Kingdom by referencing how he treats his garden, and how Richard II fails to treat England:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Go thou, and like an executioner,<br/>Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,<br/>That look too lofty in our commonwealth:<br/>All must be even in our government.<br/>You thus employ'd, I will go root away<br/>The noisome weeds, which without profit suck<br/>The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>I thought it was funny how Richard II suddenly assumes this 'tragic' role of a doomed king, and goes into these monologues about kingship and ruling, and his doomed state, etc... As the play goes on, he gets more and more poetic in his speech implying his lack of control, a direct contrast to Boilingbroke's more plain verses which imply his straightforwardness and ability to act. <br/><br/><blockquote><br/>For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground<br/>And tell sad stories of the death of kings;<br/>How some have been deposed; some slain in war,<br/>Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;<br/>Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;<br/>All murder'd: for within the hollow crown<br/>That rounds the mortal temples of a king<br/>Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>I hadn't read the historical plays by Shakespeare, so this being my first, it came as a pleasant surprise, and a terrific read. If all you've read of his is Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Midsommer's, etc.. then come back, read his historical plays!",,,1,0

It certainly is not the ONLY explanation or problem as to what happened in those stories, but it is definitely a big part of it. That thread being, our belief that as humans we can read other humans on instinct. Simply put, we can not. However, we place a level of trust in everyone around us be default because if we didn't we'd collapse as a society.<br/><br/>So the whole point of the book is to show examples of how we have become a society where we abandon trust, we believe that outward appearance is a reflection of someone's intention, we are bad lie-detectors, and that behavior is usually linked to very specific circumstances and conditions. Some of this on paper seems obvious, but when you read, you start to unfold your eyes as you connect the dots between the different stories Gladwell chased. A lot of readers infer that he is excusing crimes with his conclusions here; however, I read this as a complimentary reason as to why these crimes occurred in the first place and that having the knowledge of them could help us prevent more.<br/><br/>While reading this book, I learned that a good many of my colleagues have a low opinion of Gladwell. I certainly don't have a high or low opinion. So when I ask why they don't like him, or this book, its because my colleagues say, ""Well, he isn't really saying anything profound"" or ""Anybody could write and research what he is describing here"" or ""It seems loose, like it's not the whole thing."" I think Gladwell basically needed to make it more clear that his expression here is not a sole explanation for the stories and crimes that occurred and he examined, but rather a complimentary reason to many other aspects that led up to them.<br/><br/>With the right context, this book is brilliant. Considering that it doesn't include that crucial context, it's not near the ability of what it could be. Not Gladwell's best work, and I think everyone needs to lower their expectation of Gladwell just a bit.",,,1,0

When combined with someone who identifies with being a Martyr to a cause can lead to self-destructiveness.<br/><br/>Then there are topics around career, crime, inferiority, etc... when you get to self mutilation (something I never understood), he opened my mind into understanding what it takes to be able to partake in that. People who self-mutilate are essentially bargaining to kill a objectified part of their body rather than themselves: <i>My arm was guilty...not I...I shall sacrifice my arm</i>; more logical than death in their minds.<br/><br/>It was hard to read at times, but I think everyone needs to read this (or something like it) because we all have people or acquaintances who suffer, or maybe we ourselves do - the first step is sometimes understanding what makes you suffer, what the things are that you or someone else is doing that leads to it, and maybe - just maybe - that tiny bit of understanding and knowledge can help save someone else from similar suffering.<br/>",,,1,0

The commercial aspect of art during the renaissance and the subjects he painted do a lot to teach you about how one of the greatest eras of art formed and prospered, Isaacson's research and ability to bring it all together is tremendous and well done. There's a lot of focus on his famous notes, his style of sketching and painting, and other musings lend to the understanding of how he thought and worked. Always observing and thinking about how things tick, recreating them in art, and making engineering and sciences a work of art as well!<br/><br/>I learned quite a bit about his art and the artists that surrounded him, enough to appreciate Leonardo much more, and to look into learning more about the other artists of that time. I don't know if this is the best biography about him, it came recommended and without other context cannot say for sure since I was also quite on the fence about picking this particular one up. In the end, it's probably the most readable one, and worth picking up if you're thinking about reading about Leonardo.

If I buy a place, that is now an 'Asset'. Specifically: The thousands I pay per month in rent, essentially goes to the garbage, if I shift that to ownership of an asset, like a Condo/Co-Op, then I am now <i>investing</i> into an asset that I own.<br/><br/>There are other things that are 'Liabilities' in our lives, we can limit them or eliminate them. I unconsciously did this when I bought a used car, rather than leased a new one like my brother. My brother spent $10k+ on a new lease, that lasted two years, but then was left with no car. I paid $10K on a used car and kept that for 8 years (I donated it, but could have sold it for a small sum).<br/><br/>Another takeaway was on how we assess 'luxuries': no need for that fancy Mercedes today, if it means I can save and use that savings to invest in growing my savings.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend reading this, but don't expect clear concrete ways to become Rich, rather expect some advice to follow and research, and some framework for self-management.<br/>",,,1,0

You learn a lot about how as a species we developed numbers from having the need to count and record things, all the way to how we symbolized those recordings for easy interpretations and how we derived words and meaning for those numbers/symbols. <br/><br/>He goes through the history of both the west and the east, but its mostly focused on the west and middle east- with Romans, Vikings, Greek, etc... to Arabs, before he gives a glimpse into China and Asia in general. The dive into language formation was super informative, and you learn A LOT about language and how language came to form alongside how numbers came to form. Without being able to properly count or symbolize numbers, we wouldn't be where we are today - as a species, we wouldn't even be able to think the way we now do by default. We owe so much for all the transfer learning set upon us by our ancestors when it came to this.<br/><br/>I think one thing I really wanted to learn was more about the myths behind certain numbers, like the number 13 or 7. There were some unexplored topics there I would have loved for more information on.<br/><br/>Read this if you really love numbers, language, are naturally curious about how we developed those things, and want to better understand how we came to the state we are in today in terms of the culture of numbers, counting numbers and symbolizing numbers.",,,1,0

I instantly recognized his voice, confidence, and bravery in the writing. These essays are a glance into some of his thoughts during the civil rights era of America.<br/><br/>He explains the shock that White men are experiencing, that Black men finding their own way and their own place is frightening - shaking the foundation of heaven and earth, he says.<br/><br/>He breaks down how the adoption of White men's authority style has seeped into Black parents, and their kids are taught to comply out of fear. He keeps no comment from any person, he says it like it is, and is quite logical. He sees quite clearly that America passed its civil rights and made its reforms because it was forced to, not because it suddenly woke up on the moral side of the bed.<br/><br/>I thought Baldwin's response to Elijah about who he was: ""I'm a writer"" was such a great statement. With so many movements and so many embedments within it, he was clear on being simply a writer, a voice apart.. he had no other official affiliation.

Maybe that's the point - but nothing seemed to persuade me overall that I should really care about the characters.<br/><br/>I thought this quote: ""The moment I meet an attractive woman, I have to start pretending I have no desire to make love to her."" captures a lot - pretending essentially means that you have no control over it, so you have to become an actor and keep your cool under the lights.

I'm not a gambler, but peering into what the psyche of a gambler is within the context of this novel illuminates exactly why I am not. In the novel, Alexei shows the range of emotions a person who has beholden themselves into hard circumstances can get into in the most Dostoyevsky way, that is cynical in manner, arrogantly, and regretfully. <br/><br/>Reading about the cast of gamblers, in general, was fun and enjoyable. The characters that are painted are amusing, and you can sort of dream up the setting quite well if you've been to a casino or watched some historical crime/gangster fiction. <br/><br/>Alexei ruminates on a lot of thoughts throughout the book. For instance, he notes that a Gentleman can bet high and take a loss and show no emotion and is merely amused by it, but a Commoner will have to pretend to be composed yet meanwhile he is searing internally. The Gentleman has a complete ignorance for other's realities, and the Commoner does not know when to quit.<br/><br/>This isn't Dostoyevsky's best, but its a sliver of a story with interesting bits and pieces that fans of his will enjoy.

The lyrical way she describes light, footprints, birds, insects etc.. are so well done, that I’m tempted to say that the main character in this book is in fact the marsh itself. Early on with prose that includes things like: <i>“Tendrils of mist”, “crawing crows”, “slow moving creeks”, “alone was a feeling so vast it echoed”</i> - I loved the way she writes.<br/><br/>The plot is about Kya, who was abandoned by her family and lives in the marsh. It follows her life as she struggles to survive on her own and grow. There’s some learning to do, troubled romance, and there’s a mystery to solve. Kya surprises you at every turn, and she’s very resourceful. There is beautiful poetry, and interesting descriptions of mating habits of the different creatures in the marsh - very allusive to the plot and overall setting.<br/><br/>I really recommend picking this up, its a fun and quick read that will keep you turning pages. You’ll love the writing and plot, be enamored by the marsh, and will definitely love Kya.<br/><br/>Something I took from this book was the nature of Kya’s isolation, it bothered her at some points, but overall, she learned to make it a useful resource for her own survivability.

The premise it begins with had so many possible exciting paths that it could have took, and I was earnestly reading to see where it would take me. <br/><br/>From there, you start riding this adventure with Theo where he roughly grows and learns life's hardships quickly from a variety of sources: Hobie who makes him his apprentice, Boris who is corrupting, Pippa who he feels tethered to, Audrey his mother, and everyone else....  I love 'mentor' like characters in books, and Hobie was fabulous, and the tidbits about antique restorations and Theo's hustle were fun and inviting to read about.

Marquez isolates his story by creating the village of Macando, where his novel's characters, the Buendía family, live and grow their family.<br/><br/>Its spell binding, to the say the least. The family and their lives and business is the subject of the novel, and Macando serves as a setting and character of its own. Even though the novel's characters are a family, one of the central themes is Isolation. Incest is one way Isolation is represented, a topic that is not shied away from within the novel. Rather than offsprings of incestuous relationships sprouting physical deforms, it passes on mental traits and problems to the next generation - it's a never ending circle. Another way is character isolation/solitude within work, for instance: José Arcadio Buendía is obsessed with his inventions and experiments, or even how some characters in the family isolate others. <br/><br/>In their world, Magic is real, technology and science disrupts the 'magic'  and culture. Western culture and capitalism corrupt and bring down the Macando. Were things better before the West corrupted Macando? I think it's a question many ask about Western influence in general, and it's clear Marquez is quite critical of Western ideological and religious influence.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a difficult novel to read, mainly because we're not used to such great writing and such a different and intense story. It takes a little bit of getting used to the style and characters, but once you are in the groove of things, you'll be drawn into the tragic story of the Buendía family and their home of Macando. <br/><br/>Some words I learned while reading the translation:<br/><br/><b> Didactic</b>: intended to teach, particularly in having moral instruction as an ulterior motive.<br/><br/><br/><b>Daguerreotype</b>: a photograph taken by an early photographic process employing an iodine-sensitized silvered plate and mercury vapor.<br/><br/><br/><b>Diatribe</b>: a forceful and bitter verbal attack against someone or something.",,,1,0

Once you peel the onion, you start to see that many aspects of the lives of the characters in this novel mirror the lives of today's society and will continue to mirror those of the future - <i> this is what it means for a novel to be timeless. </i><br/><br/>Flaubert starts by painting his characters innocent: Emma has an undesirable husband who does not pay attention to her needs. Then, he starts to expose the character in ways where you're no longer sympathetic towards the character -  but you're hungry for more of their story. Emma has an insatiable desire for passion, worldly material, attention, etc.. Nothing she pursues ever meets her expectation or fantasy, and she has an ability to cast blame on everything but herself.<br/><br/>Madame Bovary makes you question what you are willing to accept, and what lengths you will go to in order to achieve something you're truly desiring - exemplified through several characters, most notably Emma's selfish pursuits. You can transfer a key message Flaubert is giving the reader to just about any other endeavor: When you selfishly and blindly commit yourself to the pursuit of your desire, you will encounter severe pain along the way, and ultimately never achieve what you set out for.<br/><br/>Every detail in this book is important, I learned from [b:Flaubert's Parrot|2176|Flaubert's Parrot|Julian Barnes|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1400866083l/2176._SY75_.jpg|1414912].

There are still - and may always be - families diseased with issues that stem from inflicted personality, poor history, and sheltered environments, and it seeps into the parents' children and affects them in so many various harmful ways. Escape seems impossible, yet Tara proves otherwise. Her story is rare, so many other children are forgotten and dragged down because of their families.<br/><br/>Tara's story reminded me that I have a lot to be thankful for; even the privilege to read her story. I hope many more read this and that some of those readers get a similar reminder and appreciation for whatever generous circumstances in life they have.<br/> ",,,1,0
