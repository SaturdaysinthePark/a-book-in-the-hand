I read Greta's collection of speeches and felt a sense of admiration for her and inspiration from her. In 2020 I decided that if a 17 year old girl can make a difference, so can I.

I've always been improving myself, and the reminder that I can do more for myself and the world is always great to have.

This isn't some amazing reading material, its just a write up of her speeches, so keep that in mind while reading. There is a lot of content in the speeches that will help you understand the global problem at hand, but you do need to read more to truly understand what is going on, and to contribute back positively to make a change.

In the end, you don't have to be making global differences to help, start with yourself, with your surrounding community, and if more people do that, we'll make a difference.
