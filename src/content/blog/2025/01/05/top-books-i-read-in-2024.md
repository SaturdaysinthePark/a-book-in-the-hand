As 2024 comes to an end, I'm reflecting on the books that made this year special. Here are my top 10 reads (and series) that earned the highest ratings and stayed with me long after I turned the final page.

## The Top 10

### 1. **An Immense World** by Ed Yong
*Science/Nature* • **★★★★★**

Yong's exploration of animal senses completely transformed how I perceive the world around us. His vivid descriptions of echolocation, magnetic fields, and electrical sensing made the invisible visible. This book filled me with wonder about the hidden sensory worlds that exist parallel to our own human experience. The writing is both scientifically rigorous and beautifully poetic.

### 2. **The Stormlight Archive** by Brandon Sanderson (Books 1-5)
*Fantasy* • **★★★★★** to **★★★★☆**

This epic fantasy series dominated my reading year, and for good reason. From The Way of Kings' masterful worldbuilding to Wind and Truth's emotional conclusion, Sanderson created something truly special. The magic systems are intricate, the character development spans thousands of pages, and the scope feels genuinely epic. These books reminded me why fantasy can be such a powerful genre for exploring themes of honor, sacrifice, and redemption.

### 3. **Shogun** by James Clavell
*Historical Fiction* • **★★★★☆**

Clavell's masterpiece transported me to feudal Japan with incredible detail and cultural depth. The clash between Western and Eastern worldviews was brilliantly portrayed through Blackthorne's journey. Despite its length, every page felt necessary to the sweeping narrative. The political intrigue and character development kept me completely engrossed throughout this epic tale. [Read my full review](/blog/2024/06/19/shogun-asian-saga/)

### 4. **The Anxious Generation** by Jonathan Haidt
*Psychology/Social Science* • **★★★★★**

Haidt's analysis of how smartphone culture has affected childhood development was both eye-opening and deeply concerning. His data-driven approach combined with practical solutions made this feel urgent and actionable. The book fundamentally changed how I think about technology's impact on mental health and child development. This is essential reading for anyone interested in understanding our current cultural moment.

### 5. **Red Rising Saga** by Pierce Brown (Books 4-6)
*Science Fiction* • **★★★☆☆** to **★★★★★**

Pierce Brown's return to the Red Rising universe was a wild ride from start to finish. While Iron Gold felt like a transitional book, Dark Age was brutally emotional, and Light Bringer delivered everything I hoped for. The character development of Darrow and the crew felt earned after the original trilogy, and the stakes genuinely felt apocalyptic. The action sequences were breathtaking while maintaining the emotional core that makes this series special.

### 6. **Outlive** by Peter Attia
*Health/Medicine* • **★★★★☆**

Attia's evidence-based approach to longevity was both practical and scientifically rigorous. His focus on preventing disease decades before symptoms appear shifted my entire perspective on health and aging. The book provided actionable insights while acknowledging the complexity of individual health decisions. This changed how I think about exercise, nutrition, and long-term health planning.

### 7. **The Inferno** by Dante Alighieri
*Classic Literature/Poetry* • **★★★★☆**

Dante's journey through Hell remains as powerful today as it was 700 years ago. The vivid imagery and moral complexity of each circle created a reading experience unlike anything else. While challenging at times, the beauty of the language and the depth of the allegory made this a rewarding read. It's remarkable how relevant the themes still feel in our modern world.

### 8. **The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind** by Julian Jaynes
*Psychology/Philosophy* • **★★★★☆**

Jaynes' controversial theory about the nature of consciousness was absolutely fascinating, even if not entirely convincing. His exploration of how human consciousness might have evolved challenged my fundamental assumptions about the mind. Whether you agree with his thesis or not, this book will make you think differently about what it means to be conscious. The implications for understanding ancient literature and psychology were mind-bending. [Read my full review](/blog/2024/06/30/the-origin-of-consciousness-in-the-breakdown-of-the-bicameral-mind/)

### 9. **The Bright Sword** by Lev Grossman
*Fantasy/Historical Fiction* • **★★★★☆**

Grossman's take on Arthurian legend was both fresh and deeply respectful of the source material. The post-Arthur world he created felt lived-in and authentic, exploring what happens after the heroic age ends. His writing was beautiful and the character development was compelling throughout. This book proved that there are still new stories to tell within familiar mythologies. [Read my full review](/blog/2024/08/27/the-bright-sword/)

### 10. **Death and the Dervish** by Meša Selimović
*Literary Fiction* • **★★★☆☆**

Selimović's meditation on faith, doubt, and human nature was beautifully written and deeply philosophical. Set in Ottoman Bosnia, it offered perspectives on spirituality and morality that felt both timeless and culturally specific. While sometimes challenging, the novel's exploration of religious doubt and moral complexity was rewarding. This book opened my eyes to Yugoslav literature and its unique voice.
