We live in a world of increasing choices, and we tend to think that more choices is better. This book argues that having more choices is not always better.

It was very relatable for a number of reasons. One from a business point of view, what am I doing to my customers when I present them choices or lack of choices? Second from a personal point of view, how am I mentally draining myself when it comes to choices.

I fall into the category of maximizers, that is someone who seeks only the best choices. That means I tend to take a longer time making a decision, looking for the best deal, making sure my choice of a product or experience exceeds all others, etc... I never classified myself that way, and furthermore, its only with certain types of products/experiences that I try to maximize. If I think and self-reflect really hard, I probably maximize the choice of who my friends are, or how I spend my time. I tend to think of the opportunity cost of everything and its trickle down effects.

Schwartz breaks down many of the aspects of what leads up to making a choice, making a choice, and the aftermath of making a choice. What he ultimately advises is that we become 'Satisficers', that is someone who makes a decision once their criteria is met. So instead of searching for the best deal, having anticipated regret, etc... a satisficer has pre-set criteria and makes their decision based on that.

I would recommend anyone to read this, especially since we're all facing the problem of having to make a decision given a number of choices. I learned a lot, and have a lot to put into practice still.

One new word I learned reading this book:
**Ameliorate**: Make (something bad) better
