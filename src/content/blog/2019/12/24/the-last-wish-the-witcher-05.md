I've played the games, but never read the books. Wow can Spakowski write. I loved the structure and format of the book, and how each story was like a play/retelling of a fairy tale. Nothing is what it seems in Geralt's world, and fairy tale's are just fiction.

> â€œPeople," Geralt turned his head, "like to invent monsters and monstrosities. Then they seem less monstrous themselves."

The Witcher is great and entertaining, with tons of action. Every story in this book is unique and interesting, no plot is recycled or overdone. There's all sorts of twists and unexpected turns in these stories. There's great pacing, and no need to rush as each story begins and closes in its own way.

Highly recommend it, and definitely will continue my journey with the next book!
