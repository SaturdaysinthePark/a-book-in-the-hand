After reading [b:The Fire Next Time|464260|The Fire Next Time|James Baldwin|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1562890148l/464260._SY75_.jpg|1129041], I just knew I had to read more [a:James Baldwin|10427|James Baldwin|https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1343346341p2/10427.jpg]. I decided to start here because the title looked familiar to me.

I've read books about the incarceration of Black Americans, and all the injustices surrounding our country's treatment of Black Americans. I have friends who experience the tragedies of this, and I have seen the news and the stories etc... What *If Beale Street Could Talk* showed me that none of those were able to was its heartbreak and disruption to a family. It's a story about love, family, injustice, and anger. There's no happy ending, just the settling in of realities of the situation our country was in during the 60s/70s, and after reading this in 2019, how it sadly is still a relevant issue.
