I've never read James Baldwin before, but right away I could tell that he was such a powerful being who wrote this novel. I instantly recognized his voice, confidence, and bravery in the writing. These essays are a glance into some of his thoughts during the civil rights era of America.

He explains the shock that White men are experiencing, that Black men finding their own way and their own place is frightening - shaking the foundation of heaven and earth, he says.

He breaks down how the adoption of White men's authority style has seeped into Black parents, and their kids are taught to comply out of fear. He keeps no comment from any person, he says it like it is, and is quite logical. He sees quite clearly that America passed its civil rights and made its reforms because it was forced to, not because it suddenly woke up on the moral side of the bed.

I thought Baldwin's response to Elijah about who he was: "I'm a writer" was such a great statement. With so many movements and so many embedments within it, he was clear on being simply a writer, a voice apart.. he had no other official affiliation. He was a Black American, and a Writer - and he felt he had his duty to be that unequivocally.

I really came out of this admiring Baldwin and understood clearly why his writing is so important, and it's STILL IMPORTANT - sadly. Read this, whoever you are.
