All aboard the train to the Ninth Kingdom, or the kingdom of frozen will. This short story felt like being aboard a train to uncertain doom. Plath's detail and symbolism is astonishing, in a short amount of time you get this eerie and uneasy feeling that the uncontrollable motion will not stop.

You're probably going to read this if you've already read [b:The Bell Jar|6514|The Bell Jar|Sylvia Plath|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1554582218l/6514._SY75_.jpg|1385044], its short enough to read in a single sitting while you contemplate your life choices and mortality.
