All aboard the train to the Ninth Kingdom, or the kingdom of frozen will. This short story felt like being aboard a train to uncertain doom. Plath's detail and symbolism is astonishing, in a short amount of time you get this eerie and uneasy feeling that the uncontrollable motion will not stop.

You're probably going to read this if you've already read *The Bell Jar* by Sylvia Plath, its short enough to read in a single sitting while you contemplate your life choices and mortality.
