I think Adam Braun is terrific, and inspirational I thought throughout the book he had great advice to give from his first hand experiences. He reminded me that I can pursue and achieve great things if I really put my mind to it. These reminders are always important, and I ca'n't thank my friend enough for sending me this book to read.

"There actually will be times in life when you should choose money over experience...but make that choice when the margin is much bigger...millions of dollars, not thousands."

I love how small things make a big difference in his mind, and how right he can be. Like 'nonprofit' has the prefix 'non', which makes it sound negative. So instead calling it 'social impact or 'for-purpose' there was a shift in its messaging, invest into a sense of purpose.

I could totally relate to the weakness of asking for money or funding. I hate asking people for things, and I thought it was so interesting that he recognizes and reveals that to the board, in order to get help from them in regards to improving that weakness.

Overall, a great read, I think everyone working to achieve their dreams will find value in Braun's recollection of his path to launching Pencils of Promise.
