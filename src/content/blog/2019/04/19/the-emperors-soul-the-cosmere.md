Spending time with someone makes your soul familiar with them, this is the essence of this book by Sanderson, and this is the essence of Shai's power as a Forger.

This isn't your typical fantasy novella, as Shai is a prisoner who can only escape her confinement if she pulls off a nearly impossible task. So meanwhile attempting to pull this off, Sanderson does an amazing job of building her character and teaching you the rules of her world and even those guarding her. I felt very connected to Shai and her work, how even while as a prisoner she was proud of her craft and wanted to make sure her work was completed and that it was the best work.

It's a short read yet has so much depth and color, independent of other work, and something that you will enjoy! Highly recommended.
