You also realize how scared everything else is of the unknown, the name of the game is self-preservation at any cost. The world now has to unite to solve the problem of an alien civilization that is approaching and acting on belief that they are self-preserving. They have to advanced civilization and technology drastically, invent space travel, invent lightspeed travel, and *much* more.

How do you and society act when you know impending doom is surely 400 years away? How do you contribute to saving a generation that your grandchildren's grandchildren will never meet?
