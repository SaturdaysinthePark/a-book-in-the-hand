How satisfying it is when an author ties everything together, and marks the conclusion of a story with answers and explanations. It's what readers want, and Sanderson is able to deliver in a meaningful way, almost as if everything was obvious. I thought to myself often saying, "Oh yeah, that makes sense. Since Rashek did this, it means that works like that..." and so on.

Elend got a lot more attention and growth in this book. When I first met Elend in *The Final Empire*, I sort of assumed he was that typical throwaway charlatan character. I'm happy that he has been a strong and pretty consistent character, whose growth in self-realization, leadership and relationships have been pretty great. Vin had a lot of internal struggle in *The Well of Ascension*, I think the fact that Elend is Mistborn in this book gave her some room to finally look into herself a bit more. Her time and conflict with Ruin is what probably saved her arc here. Sazed totally transformed in this book, he seemed like he finally 'unlocked' himself. 

Reading about what Rashek/Lord Ruler had to in every chapter was really cool. Part of me kept reading to read the little blurb in the beginning of every chapter to piece together the history and lore of this world.

All in all, what a satisfying end this story, it's brilliant writing, nothing seemed rushed. There was no plot device introduced for the sake of tying things together, you know everything was planned and plotted out from the get-go Sanderson's world.
