A book about how things in motion are the most beautiful. I feel that way sometimes. This is a collection of writings, essays, stories, and travel musings. However, I would say there is something beautiful about something that can sit still in the noise. This book was full of motion, but maybe too much motion. Every few pages I felt thrown off. I want to love this more, but the sporadicness of this, and the lack of tone, really brought this down for me.
