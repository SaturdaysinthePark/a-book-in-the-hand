I love this book, I love Hemingway and his recounting of his life in Paris, you truly feel what it meant to be in his shoes at that time there. I love his relationships, and his adventures with Fitzgerald, who is totally bananas. Hemingway and his wife have a splendid love, and their life in Paris sort of has a rosy tint, but still manages to make it clear that he's surviving on pennies.

I read this while on a business trip in Paris, and even strolled over to Shakespeare and Company to complete the pilgrimage. I walked to the Louvre and went to the statue gardens to see just exactly what Fitzgerald and Hemingway decided to after Fitzgerald's scare. 

All in all, I really enjoyed reading this, and highly recommend fans of Hemingway, classic literature, or Paris to pick this up. 

> "I wish I had died before I loved anybody but her"

I love that quote, it encapsulates the feeling of remembering a prior love before having moved on to new love, when truly the old (often the first) one was so sweet.

Some new words I learned that I liked:

*inaccrochable*: A picture that cannot be hung or sold because it cannot be hung.
*poivrottes*: Female drunkards
