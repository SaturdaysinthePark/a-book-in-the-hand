How many times I have walked into the Museum of Modern Art here in New York and wondered to myself, what brought about *Number 1A*? Then walk around to see more of his work and ask myself what makes Pollock's art so important? This is one of the best biographies I have ever read, its so well detailed and sheds light so far into the early modern art scene in New York. There's a reason it won the Pulitzer, its well written and well researched.

Up to this point, I had received different perspectives from reading *Andy Warhol* by Victor Bockris to Marcel *Duchamp* by Calvin Tomkins biographies. How different some artists are mentally, and what drives them! The politics of art and the showrunners who made the artists we've come to know famous. The authors also do a great job of detailing Pollock's exploration of different techniques, who his teachers were and how he learned, and how he dealt with the social aspects of the New York art scene - a lot of which drove him quite over the edge!

Read this for all of the above as well as the antics that made Jackson infamous, and make you gasp while you read.
