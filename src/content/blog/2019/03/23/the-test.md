This short novel is quite interesting...think of Black Mirror, and now think of taking a citizenship test... a nightmare of a test, nothing what you expected. You're not prepared for this, you're not even sure if you're in a test at some points. 

Will you pass?

In the end, this book is a commentary on immigration, citizenship status, etc... it challenges government into how far will it go to in screening and testing immigrants and how difficult will government . prove to make their lives to be.... 

Definitely worth the quick read.
