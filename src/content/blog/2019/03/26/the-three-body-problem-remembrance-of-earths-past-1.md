The Sci Fi books we read 100 years ago shaped our world today and the approaching century. *The Three-Body Problem* by [Liu Cixin](/authors/liu-cixin/) will do the same for the next 500-1000 years. 

The beginning of a trilogy of sci-fi books that explore first contact, space travel, lightspeed and all the mental, political, ethical and scientific problems involved in a very realistic point of view. This isn't star trek or star wars, this isn't 'cool' fantasy sci-fi... but its mind blowing to those of us who were in awe during Physics class and loved the movie Contact growing up. Its grown up Sci fi. 

Read this if you ever thought about how the way you perceive Physics and the Universe may just be a consequence of an *other* being, or if you ever thought about the consequences to first contact, and other things such as that.

A word I learned that I loved:

**Equanimity**: mental calmness, composure, and evenness of temper, especially in a difficult situation.
