I love Gaiman, and I've read so many of his prior novels, i've never read Pratchett before this, but had only heard great things. I've also never read a novel written by two great authors, and with all the praise and hype, this was easily a must read for myself. However, I wouldn't say this is a book for fans of Gaiman's other novels.

This book is humorous and makes fun of a lot of religion and the whole concept of the judgement day. It does get overly complicated, and then you start wondering, what is the point of all this. I thought the characters and comments were funny and witty, but I don't know if that was enough for me to say its a must-read, I would rather go back and read [b:Neverwhere|14497|Neverwhere (London Below, #1)|Neil Gaiman|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348747943l/14497._SX50_.jpg|16534].
