I love Gaiman, and I've read so many of his prior novels, i've never read Pratchett before this, but had only heard great things. I've also never read a novel written by two great authors, and with all the praise and hype, this was easily a must read for myself. However, I wouldn't say this is a book for fans of Gaiman's other novels.

This book is humorous and makes fun of a lot of religion and the whole concept of the judgement day. It does get overly complicated, and then you start wondering, what is the point of all this. I thought the characters and comments were funny and witty, but I don't know if that was enough for me to say its a must-read, I would rather go back and read *Neverwhere* by Neil Gaiman.

Read this if you enjoyed *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* by Douglas Adams
