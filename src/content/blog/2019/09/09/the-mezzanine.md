This short novel takes place during an afternoon lunch break, and it is literally just about Howie's, the narrator, mundane thoughts while riding an escalator. We all have these mundane thoughts and think about these odd bubbled real world experiences we have that dance around etiquette and behavior with people in all sorts of situations, almost like watching an episode of *Seinfeld* or *Curb Your Enthusiasm*.  

What's really funny is that Howie is reading [b:Meditations|30659|Meditations|Marcus Aurelius|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1421618636l/30659._SY75_.jpg|31010], it's like Baker wants to nod at the difference in thoughts from a Roman Emperor and a boring office worker.

It's a fun little read, with all sorts of interesting thoughts that will amuse you. I think Baker took on a fun little challenge, it's not easy to entertain with the mundane.
