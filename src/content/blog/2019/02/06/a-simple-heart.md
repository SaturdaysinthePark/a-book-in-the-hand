Admittedly, I read this book because I wanted to prepare myself to read Julian Barnes's [Flaubert's Parrot](/book-reviews/flauberts-parrot). I also quite enjoyed [Madame Bovary](/book-reviews/madame-bovary), so was looking forward to something short by Flaubert.

The short novel is about a servant named Félicité who really is someone with a simple heart. A simple story about a woman who pours her heart and devotion into everything. Whats quite fascinating is that even in the un-caring, unaffectionate world, Félicité never wavers in her ability to be caring. 

Sometimes I felt irritated by Félicité, and wonder if you are supposed to, is she just an utter fool, or is she pure good? Or, is it I, who is a fool for being irritated at Félicité?
