I'm a fan of P. Djèlí Clark's Djinn short stories and novel, so thought I'd give this a try. By the end of it, I felt like this book was a bit of a mess.

- Overall, I liked the premise of this book: 'what if the KKK were actual wizards and had actual demons that worked with them' - this sort of magic and fantasy spin on it all was interesting
- I really liked Sadie, she was such a cool character and I liked her persona and mannerism
- At some point the book got very complicated and it was hard to keep track of all the threads and reveals
- The author does a great job with visuals and horror - I wasn't super excited to be reading the demon/monster's descriptions (I mean that as a compliment)
- Parallels and writing devices early in the novel were great, especially when alluding to *The Birth of a Nation*
- It was hard to keep track of all the action and events happening, especially with the introduction of more and more fantasy elements
- By the end, I felt burnt out - I enjoyed parts of the book, but felt overwhelmed by the end, even though it was a short read
